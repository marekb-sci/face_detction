# Face detection with FasterRCNN and FPN

This repo is a training example of usage PyTorch FasterRCNN with FPN head for object detetcion. It uses [face.evoLVe](https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe.PyTorch) detections as a ground truth. 

The repo offers:

- simple 
- example of backbone substitution to mobilenetV2
